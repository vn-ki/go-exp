/*
godoc is awesome.

You have to do zero work (well you have to write comments).

You can have code here too.

	import "github.com/vn-ki/go-exp/stringutil"

	stringutil.Capitalize("Awesome")

I would love markdown support here but the go community seems to be against it.
They love only plain text.

I miss *emojis* :sigh:
